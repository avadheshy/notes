# Consistent Hashing in System Design

## Overview

Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when the hash table is resized. It's a fundamental concept in distributed systems, particularly useful for load balancing, distributed caching, and data partitioning across multiple servers.

Unlike traditional hashing where adding or removing a server can cause a massive redistribution of data, consistent hashing ensures that only a small fraction of keys need to be relocated when the system scales up or down.

## The Problem with Traditional Hashing

### Simple Hash Function Approach
```
server_index = hash(key) % number_of_servers
```

**Problems:**
- Adding/removing a server changes the modulo operation
- Most keys get redistributed to different servers
- Causes cache misses and data movement
- Poor scalability in dynamic environments

**Example:**
With 3 servers and key "user123":
- `hash("user123") % 3 = 2` → Server 2
- Add one server: `hash("user123") % 4 = 1` → Server 1 (moved!)

## How Consistent Hashing Works

### The Hash Ring Concept

Consistent hashing maps both servers and keys onto a circular hash space (typically 0 to 2^32-1). This creates a "hash ring" where:

1. **Servers are positioned** on the ring using their hash values
2. **Keys are positioned** on the ring using their hash values  
3. **Each key is assigned** to the first server found clockwise from its position

### Basic Algorithm Steps

1. **Create Hash Ring**: Define a circular space (e.g., 0 to 2^32-1)
2. **Position Servers**: Hash each server identifier and place on ring
3. **Position Keys**: Hash each key and place on ring
4. **Assign Keys**: Each key belongs to the next server clockwise on the ring

### Visual Representation
```
                    Server A (hash=1000)
                         ↓
              0 -------- Ring -------- 2^32-1
                    ↗         ↖
            Key X (hash=500)   Server B (hash=2000)
                              Key Y (hash=1500)
```

## Implementation Details

### Basic Consistent Hash Implementation
```python
import hashlib
import bisect

class ConsistentHash:
    def __init__(self, nodes=None, replicas=3):
        self.replicas = replicas
        self.ring = {}
        self.sorted_keys = []
        
        if nodes:
            for node in nodes:
                self.add_node(node)
    
    def _hash(self, key):
        return int(hashlib.md5(key.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest(), 16)
    
    def add_node(self, node):
        for i in range(self.replicas):
            virtual_key = f"{node}:{i}"
            key = self._hash(virtual_key)
            self.ring[key] = node
            bisect.insort(self.sorted_keys, key)
    
    def remove_node(self, node):
        for i in range(self.replicas):
            virtual_key = f"{node}:{i}"
            key = self._hash(virtual_key)
            del self.ring[key]
            self.sorted_keys.remove(key)
    
    def get_node(self, key):
        if not self.ring:
            return None
            
        hash_key = self._hash(key)
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(self.sorted_keys, hash_key)
        
        if idx == len(self.sorted_keys):
            idx = 0
            
        return self.ring[self.sorted_keys[idx]]
```

### Virtual Nodes (Replicas)

To address load balancing issues, consistent hashing uses **virtual nodes**:

- Each physical server is mapped to multiple positions on the ring
- Provides better distribution of keys across servers
- Reduces the impact of hot spots

**Benefits:**
- More uniform load distribution
- Better fault tolerance
- Smoother addition/removal of nodes

## Key Properties and Benefits

### Minimal Key Movement
When a server is added or removed, only keys between that server and the previous server (counter-clockwise) need to be relocated.

**Mathematical Property:**
- With N servers, adding/removing one server affects only ~1/N of the keys
- Traditional hashing affects ~(N-1)/N of the keys

### Load Balancing
With virtual nodes, each server handles approximately the same amount of data:
- Virtual nodes spread server presence across the ring
- Reduces variance in load distribution
- Typical setup: 100-200 virtual nodes per physical server

### Fault Tolerance
- Server failures only affect adjacent keys on the ring
- Failed server's load is distributed among remaining servers
- No single point of failure in the hash function

## Real-World Applications

### Distributed Caching Systems

**Memcached with Consistent Hashing:**
```python
# Client-side implementation
class MemcachedClient:
    def __init__(self, servers):
        self.hash_ring = ConsistentHash(servers)
    
    def set(self, key, value):
        server = self.hash_ring.get_node(key)
        # Connect to server and set value
        
    def get(self, key):
        server = self.hash_ring.get_node(key)
        # Connect to server and get value
```

**Redis Cluster:**
- Uses hash slots (16,384 slots) mapped to nodes
- Each key is mapped to a slot using CRC16
- Slots are distributed across cluster nodes

### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

**Use Cases:**
- Route requests to nearest edge server
- Balance load across multiple data centers
- Handle server failures gracefully

### Distributed Databases

**Apache Cassandra:**
- Uses consistent hashing for data partitioning
- Each node is responsible for a range of hash values
- Replication factor determines how many nodes store each key

**Amazon DynamoDB:**
- Partitions data using consistent hashing
- Automatically handles scaling and rebalancing
- Virtual nodes for uniform distribution

### Load Balancers

**HAProxy with Consistent Hashing:**
```
backend web_servers
    balance uri
    hash-type consistent
    server web1 192.168.1.10:80 check
    server web2 192.168.1.11:80 check
    server web3 192.168.1.12:80 check
```

## Variations and Enhancements

### Bounded Load Consistent Hashing
Addresses the problem of load imbalance by setting maximum load per server:
- Each server has a maximum capacity
- Overflow keys are assigned to the next available server
- Provides better load balancing guarantees

### Jump Consistent Hash
Google's algorithm that provides:
- O(1) time complexity for key lookup
- Minimal memory usage
- Good distribution properties

```python
def jump_consistent_hash(key, num_buckets):
    b, j = -1, 0
    while j < num_buckets:
        b = j
        key = ((key * 2862933555777941757) + 1) & 0xffffffffffffffff
        j = int((b + 1) * (1 << 31) / ((key >> 33) + 1))
    return b
```

### Rendezvous Hashing (HRW)
Alternative approach that:
- Computes hash for each server-key pair
- Assigns key to server with highest hash value
- Provides good distribution without a ring structure

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Add/Remove Node**: O(V log N) where V is virtual nodes, N is total nodes
- **Key Lookup**: O(log V) using binary search on sorted ring
- **Memory Usage**: O(V) for storing virtual node mappings

### Space Complexity
- Ring storage: O(V × N) where V is virtual nodes per server
- Sorted keys array: O(V × N)
- Typically manageable even for large clusters

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Hot Spots and Load Imbalance

**Problem:** Some servers may receive disproportionately more keys

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase Virtual Nodes**: More virtual nodes = better distribution
2. **Bounded Load**: Set maximum load per server
3. **Custom Hash Functions**: Choose hash functions that distribute keys evenly

### Hash Function Selection

**Requirements:**
- Good distribution properties
- Fast computation
- Avalanche effect (small input changes cause large output changes)

**Common Choices:**
- MD5: Good distribution, moderate speed
- SHA-1: Better security, slower
- CRC32: Fast, simpler distribution
- MurmurHash: Fast with good distribution

### Network Partitions

**Challenge:** Network splits can cause inconsistent views of the hash ring

**Solutions:**
- Use consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos) for ring membership
- Implement gossip protocols for eventual consistency
- Design for partition tolerance with conflict resolution

## Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Choose Appropriate Virtual Node Count**
   - Too few: Poor load balancing
   - Too many: Increased memory usage
   - Sweet spot: 100-200 per physical node

2. **Handle Node Failures Gracefully**
   ```python
   def get_node_with_fallback(self, key, exclude_nodes=None):
       if not exclude_nodes:
           exclude_nodes = set()
       
       for attempt in range(len(self.sorted_keys)):
           node = self._get_next_node(key, attempt)
           if node not in exclude_nodes:
               return node
       return None
   ```

3. **Monitor Load Distribution**
   - Track key count per server
   - Monitor request latency
   - Alert on significant imbalances

4. **Use Consistent Hash Functions**
   - Same hash function across all clients
   - Version hash functions for upgrades
   - Test distribution properties

### Operational Considerations

**Gradual Node Addition:**
```python
def add_node_gradually(self, new_node, migration_rate=0.1):
    # Add node with limited virtual nodes initially
    self.add_node_with_replicas(new_node, replicas=1)
    
    # Gradually increase virtual nodes
    for i in range(1, self.target_replicas):
        time.sleep(migration_rate)  # Allow data migration
        self.add_virtual_node(new_node, i)
```

**Health Checks:**
- Remove unhealthy nodes from ring
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use heartbeats for node monitoring

## Testing Strategies

### Distribution Testing
```python
def test_distribution(hash_ring, num_keys=10000):
    server_counts = {}
    
    for i in range(num_keys):
        key = f"key_{i}"
        server = hash_ring.get_node(key)
        server_counts[server] = server_counts.get(server, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate distribution variance
    avg_keys = num_keys / len(hash_ring.nodes)
    variance = sum((count - avg_keys) ** 2 for count in server_counts.values())
    
    return variance / len(server_counts)
```

### Failure Simulation
```python
def test_node_failure_impact(hash_ring, num_keys=10000):
    # Record initial distribution
    initial_mapping = {}
    for i in range(num_keys):
        key = f"key_{i}"
        initial_mapping[key] = hash_ring.get_node(key)
    
    # Remove a node
    failed_node = random.choice(hash_ring.nodes)
    hash_ring.remove_node(failed_node)
    
    # Count moved keys
    moved_keys = 0
    for key, original_node in initial_mapping.items():
        if original_node == failed_node:
            continue
        if hash_ring.get_node(key) != original_node:
            moved_keys += 1
    
    return moved_keys / num_keys
```

## Conclusion

Consistent hashing is a powerful technique for building scalable distributed systems. It provides:

- **Minimal data movement** when scaling up or down
- **Excellent fault tolerance** with localized impact of failures
- **Good load balancing** through virtual nodes
- **Simple conceptual model** that's easy to reason about

The technique is widely adopted in production systems including Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis Cluster, and various CDN implementations. Understanding consistent hashing is essential for designing distributed systems that need to handle dynamic scaling and node failures gracefully.

While it introduces some complexity compared to simple hashing schemes, the benefits of consistent hashing make it indispensable for large-scale distributed applications where availability and performance are critical.
