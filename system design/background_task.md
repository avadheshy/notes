# Job Classification & Flow Diagrams

## 1. One-Time Delayed Jobs

**Trigger:** Manually or by business logic
**Example:** Send a welcome email 5 minutes after signup
**Tooling:** Celery with ETA (Python), or RabbitMQ with TTL

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[User Signup]
      |
[Web App (Flask/Django)] --enqueue--> [Redis/RabbitMQ Queue]
                                          |
                                  [Worker (Celery/RQ)]
                                          |
                                 [Email Service (SMTP)]
```

## 2. Recurring Scheduled Jobs

**Trigger:** Cron or scheduler
**Example:** Backup database daily at midnight
**Tooling:** Celery Beat, Sidekiq-Cron, Hangfire (C#)

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[Scheduler (Celery Beat / Cron)]
               |
        [Redis Queue]
               |
         [Worker Process]
               |
  [Backup: Filesystem / S3 / RDS Snapshot]
```

## 3. Event-Driven Jobs

**Trigger:** System or user events, Pub/Sub
**Example:** Generate invoice PDF after payment
**Tooling:** Kafka, RabbitMQ (fanout), AWS SNS/SQS

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[Payment Service] --emit--> [Kafka Topic: payment.success]
                                     |
                        [Invoice Generator Service]
                            (Consumer of Kafka topic)
                                     |
                              [PDF Storage / Email]
```

## 4. Retryable Jobs

**Trigger:** On failure (network errors, API failures)
**Example:** Retry webhook delivery with exponential backoff
**Tooling:** Celery retry policies, Sidekiq retries, custom backoff logic

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[Webhook Delivery Failure]
           |
   [Retry Logic + Backoff]
           ↓
     [Retry Queue with Delay]
           ↓
   [Worker Reprocesses Job]
```

## 5. Data Sync Jobs

**Trigger:** Periodic API polling
**Example:** Sync Google Calendar events
**Tooling:** Celery Beat, Redis, OAuth, Conflict resolution logic

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[Celery Beat / Cron Trigger]
               |
       [Redis Task Queue]
               |
 [OAuth Worker Syncs Remote API]
               |
     [Database Update / Merge Conflicts]
```

## 6. ML Model Training Jobs

**Trigger:** Scheduled or triggered by new data availability
**Example:** Retrain recommendation model weekly
**Tooling:** Airflow, Prefect, S3, Spark/TensorFlow, MLflow

**Flow Diagram:**

```
[Airflow DAG Trigger / Event]
              |
     [Training Job (e.g., Spark)]
              |
     [Model Artifact (S3 / MLflow)]
              |
    [Deployment or Batch Scoring System]
```


#  Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Event-Driven Architecture is a software design pattern in which components of a system communicate by emitting and reacting to events. It is highly decoupled and ideal for scalable, distributed, and real-time systems.

## Key Concepts
### Event: 
A significant change in state, like user.created or payment.success.

### Event Producer:
 The component that emits the event.

### Event Consumer: 
The component that listens and reacts to the event.

### Event Broker (optional):
 Middleware like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SNS that transports events.

## How It Works
```
[Producer Service] -- emits event --> [Broker (e.g., Kafka Topic)]
                                             |
                                   [Consumer Service(s)]
                                   (React to the event)
```
## Benefits
### Loose coupling: 
Producers and consumers don’t need to know about each other.

### Scalability: 
Easily scale consumers independently.

### Flexibility:
 Add new consumers without changing existing producers.

## Use Cases
Microservices communication

Real-time updates (e.g., notifications)

Asynchronous processing (e.g., order fulfillment)

# Webhooks
Webhooks are a specific implementation of event-driven communication over HTTP. Instead of using a broker, a producer sends an HTTP POST request directly to a consumer when an event occurs.

##   How Webhooks Work
Consumer registers a callback URL with the producer (e.g., via dashboard or API).

When an event occurs, the producer POSTs JSON data to the consumer’s URL.

```
[Payment Gateway] -- POST --> https://yourapp.com/payment-success/
```
## Benefits
Simple to implement (HTTP-based)

Real-time notifications

Works well for integrations (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)

##  Challenges
Consumer must be always available (to receive POST requests)

Retry logic is essential (handle downtime)

Security concerns (verify source of the request, use HMACs or tokens)

##  Typical Webhook Use Cases
Stripe sending payment confirmation

GitHub pushing commit notifications

Slack sending messages to custom apps

In summary:

EDA is a broad pattern used across systems with or without HTTP.

Webhooks are a lightweight, HTTP-based implementation of EDA, great for external integrations.

Let me know if you want to visualize EDA vs Webhooks with diagrams or compare them to polling or message queues.
