Here's a comparison of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, and InfluxDB based on ACID, CAP theorem, read/write-heavy workloads, scaling (horizontal/vertical), and best use case:

# 1. MySQL
## ACID:
Fully ACID-compliant for transactional operations.
## CAP Theorem:
Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CA when distributed, as it prioritizes consistency over availability).
## Read/Write:
Optimized for read-heavy workloads, but write-heavy workloads can perform well with proper indexing and optimization.
## Scaling:
Primarily vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single machine).
Horizontal scaling is possible but challenging (requires sharding or clustering tools like Galera Cluster).
## Best Use Case:
Small to medium-sized applications with structured data (e.g., e-commerce websites, blogs).
Applications requiring strong consistency and transactional integrity.
# 2. PostgreSQL
## ACID:
Fully ACID-compliant, with advanced transactional support.
## CAP Theorem:
Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CA).
## Read/Write:
Balanced performance for read and write-heavy workloads, especially for complex queries.
Excellent for analytical workloads.
## Scaling:
Primarily vertical scaling, though horizontal scaling is supported through extensions (e.g., Citus).
## Best Use Case:
Complex data relationships, analytics, and geospatial applications (e.g., financial systems, data warehouses).
# 3. MongoDB
## ACID:
Supports ACID transactions since version 4.0, but traditionally optimized for eventual consistency.
## CAP Theorem:
Partition Tolerance and Availability (AP). It can be configured for strong consistency but defaults to eventual consistency.
## Read/Write:
Optimized for write-heavy workloads and unstructured data.
Performs well for high read/write concurrency.
## Scaling:
Excellent horizontal scaling through built-in sharding and replication.
## Best Use Case:
Applications with rapidly evolving schemas, high write throughput, and unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., content management systems, IoT platforms).
# 4. Cassandra
## ACID:
Not ACID-compliant. Instead, it follows the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventual consistency).
## CAP Theorem:
Partition Tolerance and Availability (AP). Consistency can be tuned per query using configurable consistency levels.
## Read/Write:
Designed for write-heavy workloads and large-scale data ingestion.
Reads are efficient but not as optimized as writes.
## Scaling:
Excellent horizontal scaling with no single point of failure.
## Best Use Case:
Distributed, fault-tolerant systems with massive write requirements and high availability (e.g., log analytics, recommendation engines).
# 5. Neo4j
## ACID:
Fully ACID-compliant for graph operations.
## CAP Theorem:
Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CA).
## Read/Write:
Optimized for read-heavy workloads involving graph traversal and relationships.
Writes are efficient but depend on the graph's complexity.
## Scaling:
Primarily vertical scaling, though horizontal scaling is possible with Neo4j Enterprise features.
## Best Use Case:
Applications with complex relationships and frequent traversals (e.g., social networks, fraud detection).
# 6. InfluxDB
## ACID:
Not fully ACID-compliant. Prioritizes high write performance and eventual consistency.
## CAP Theorem:
Partition Tolerance and Availability (AP). Optimized for eventual consistency.
## Read/Write:
Optimized for write-heavy workloads, especially for time-series data.
Efficient for real-time and aggregated reads.
## Scaling:
Scales horizontally for write-heavy operations and large datasets.
## Best Use Case:
Time-series data like IoT telemetry, monitoring systems, and real-time analytics.

Summary
Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL): Great for structured data with strong consistency.
NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Cassandra): Ideal for flexible schemas and high scalability.
Specialized Databases (Neo4j, InfluxDB): Use Neo4j for graph data and InfluxDB for time-series data.
