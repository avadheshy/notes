The CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer's Theorem, is a concept in distributed systems that states that it is impossible for a distributed data system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

# Consistency (C):

Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
In simpler terms, all nodes in the system have the same data at the same time.
# Availability (A):

Every request (read or write) receives a response, even if some nodes are down.
The system remains operational, and no request will time out indefinitely.
# Partition Tolerance (P):

The system continues to function despite network partitions (communication breakdowns between nodes).

A partition occurs when some nodes in the system cannot communicate with others due to network issues.
# Key Insight of CAP Theorem:
In the presence of a network partition, a distributed system can provide only two of the three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, or Partition Tolerance.

Since network partitions are unavoidable in distributed systems (e.g., due to hardware failures, network issues, or scaling across data centers), the theorem implies that you must choose between:

Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP): The system sacrifices availability during a partition.

Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP): The system sacrifices consistency during a partition.
