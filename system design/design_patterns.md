# What's a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

---
Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.
# Classification of patterns
There are 3 types of patterns
# 1. creational design pattern
  Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created. There are two main themes in these patterns:

- They keep information about the specific classes used in the system hidden.
- They hide the details of how instances of these classes are created and assembled.
# There are 5 types of creational design pattern 
## 1. Prototype Design Pattern
  singleton->eager/syncronization/lazy/double lock
  Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
## Singleton Design Pattern

  

# 2. structural Design Pattern
- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
# 3. Behavioral Design Pattern
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
