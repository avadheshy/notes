# Client Server Architecture
The client-server architecture is a model for networked systems that divides tasks or workloads between two primary entities: clients and servers. It is widely used in software and networking applications.

# Key Components:
## Client:

A client is a device or software application that sends requests to the server for specific resources or services.

Examples: A web browser (e.g., Chrome), a mobile app
## Server:

A server is a device or software application that processes requests from clients and returns the requested resources or services.

Examples: A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), a database server (e.g., MySQL), or an API server.
# How It Works:
## Request:

The client sends a request to the server over a network. For example, when you type a URL in your browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
## Processing:

The server processes the request, performs necessary actions (e.g., retrieving data from a database), and prepares a response.
## Response:

The server sends the response back to the client. This could be an HTML page, JSON data, an image, or any other resource.
# Types of Client-Server Architecture:
## Two-Tier Architecture:

Direct communication between client and server.

Example: A client application directly communicates with a database server.
## Three-Tier Architecture:

Introduces an additional layer, typically an application server.

Example: A web browser communicates with a web server, which then interacts with a database server.

Advantages:
Improves scalability and security.
Separates concerns (e.g., UI logic, business logic, data storage).
## Multi-Tier Architecture (N-tier):

More layers are added for better scalability and modularity.

Example: Load balancers, cache servers, or microservices may be added.

Advantages:

Scalability: Servers can be upgraded or replicated to handle more clients.

Centralized Management: Easier to manage and maintain resources.

Specialization: Clients and servers can specialize in different tasks, optimizing performance.

Disadvantages:

Network Dependency: Requires a stable network connection.

Server Overload: A single server can become a bottleneck if it can't handle the load.

Cost: Setting up and maintaining servers can be expensive.

Examples:

Web Browsing: The browser (client) communicates with a web server to fetch web pages.

Email: Your email app (client) communicates with an email server to send and receive messages.

Online Banking: The app (client) interacts with servers for transactions and account management.

This architecture forms the backbone of most modern distributed systems, from simple websites to complex cloud services.
