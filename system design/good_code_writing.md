# Follow naming convention 
- snack_case for variable, functions, methods, modul name, packege name and global variable name.
- PaskalCase for class names.
- UPPER_SNACK_CASE for constant.
- _single_leading_underscore for private members.
- __double_leading_underscores__ for magic methods.
# Follow SOLID principle

 - If you are making a function then put its code in try except blog.
 - If you are making if else on magic strings then put the string in the enum class.
 - If you are directly applying math operation on constant then assign that on variable.
 - If variable are passed in function then first test for None and then apply operation on it.
 - Use comprehension/iter instead of loop
 - Try to use built in modules instead of writing it.
 - If there is more memory consumed then try to use generator.
