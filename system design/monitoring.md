# System Monitoring Concepts in System Design

Monitoring is an essential aspect of modern system design. It ensures systems are reliable, secure, performant, and available. Below are key monitoring components:

---

## 1. Health Monitoring
**Purpose:** Check if a service or system is running correctly.

- Monitors system components (CPU, memory, disk usage).
- Commonly implemented with health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ping`).
- Helps auto-scaling systems or load balancers detect unhealthy nodes.

---

## 2. Availability Monitoring
**Purpose:** Ensure the system is reachable and operational.

- Tracks uptime/downtime of services.
- Uses synthetic transactions or heartbeat signals.
- Helps meet SLA targets and maintain user trust.

---

## 3. Performance Monitoring
**Purpose:** Measure how well the system performs under load.

- Tracks latency, throughput, error rate, and system load.
- Helps identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic.

---

## 4. Security Monitoring
**Purpose:** Detect and prevent security breaches or anomalies.

- Monitors for unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, intrusion attempts.
- Alerts on suspicious activity or policy violations.
- Integrates with security information and event management (SIEM) tools.

---

## 5. SLA Monitoring
**Purpose:** Ensure agreed service level objectives (SLOs) are met.

- Tracks uptime, response times, and error rates.
- Triggers alerts when thresholds are breached.
- Enables accountability between service providers and clients.

---

## 6. Usage Monitoring
**Purpose:** Analyze how the system is used by end users.

- Tracks metrics like API usage, feature access, session counts.
- Helps in capacity planning, pricing, and user behavior analysis.
- Often integrated with analytics tools.

---

## 7. Instrumentation, Visualization, and Alerting
**Instrumentation:**
- Adding code to expose metrics and traces (e.g., counters, histograms, logs).
- Ensures observability into internal system behavior.

**Visualization:**
- Dashboards (Grafana, Kibana) to represent metrics, logs, and traces visually.
- Helps in real-time decision-making and diagnostics.

**Alerting:**
- Notifies stakeholders (via email, Slack, SMS) when anomalies or threshold breaches occur.
- Can be severity-based and integrated with incident management tools (e.g., PagerDuty).

Monitoring is not an afterthought—it’s foundational for building reliable, scalable systems.
