# steps to become good software engineer
→ Read code and documents (more than  write)

→ Talk to other engineers and teams, asking questions, clarifying, and sharing context

→ Listen deeply, sometimes for long stretches, just to really understand

→ Spend hours thinking, mapping ideas, sketching on whiteboards, erasing, and starting over

- Anyone can copy paste code. But that's not enginnering. If dont know why it works , you'll never know why it breaks.
- you are lagging in requirement gathering or I can say understanding project.
- You are not handling edge cases.
- In conversations your focus is telling somethings not analyzing statement.
