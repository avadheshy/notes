#  Two Pointer Pattern - LeetCode Questions

# 1. Opposite Ends (Start and End Pointers)
 Pattern:
Use one pointer at the beginning and one at the end of the array.

Move them toward each other based on some condition.

## Common Use Cases:
Check if array can be a palindrome.

Find pairs with a target sum in a sorted array.

Container With Most Water (maximize area between pointers).

Example:
```
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        s = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if s == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif s < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
```
# 2. Fast and Slow Pointers (aka Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection)
    Pattern:
Use two pointers: one moves twice as fast as the other.

Great for detecting cycles, middle of a list, etc.

#  Common Use Cases:
Detect a cycle in a linked list.

Find the middle of a linked list.

Remove N-th node from end.

Example:
```
def hasCycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```
# 3. Sliding Window
## Pattern:
Move both pointers in the same direction to maintain a window.

Resize the window to satisfy constraints.

## Common Use Cases:
Longest substring without repeating characters.

Minimum size subarray sum.

Max average subarray.

ðŸ§  Example:
```
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```
# 4. Merge Pattern (like in merge sort)
Pattern:
Used to merge two sorted arrays/lists.

Move pointers in both arrays simultaneously.

## Common Use Cases:
Merge two sorted lists.

Intersection of two sorted arrays.

## Example:
```
def merge_sorted(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = 0
    result = []
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            result.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    result += arr1[i:]
    result += arr2[j:]
    return result
```
# 5. Partitioning Around a Pivot (Used in Quicksort, Dutch National Flag)
ðŸ“Œ Pattern:
Rearrange array elements with two (or three) pointers to partition around a pivot.

## Common Use Cases:
Quicksort

Sort colors (Dutch National Flag problem)

Example:
```
def sortColors(nums):
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 0:
            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
        else:
            nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
            high -= 1
```

##  Tips
- Use **Opposite Ends** for sorted arrays when searching for pairs.
- Use **Fast/Slow** for cycle detection and middle finding in linked lists.
- Use **Sliding Window** for substring/array problems with a condition.
- Use **Merge** for sorted array/list combination.
- Use **Partitioning** to reorganize array elements with O(1) space.
