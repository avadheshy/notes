Here are some ways to solve a given problem

## 1. If there is a posibility of both  dfs and bfs then prefer bfs instead of bfs because it gives early solution.

There were some areas I had limited exposure to, like Disjoint Set Union (DSU). Though I was aware of it, I didn't fully grasp its application in complex graph problems. Once I mastered it, many tough graph problems became much easier.

I also studied:

Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees for range updates
Dynamic Programming with space optimization techniques
Memoization & Recursion
Disjoint Set Rollbacks for graph-related problems
