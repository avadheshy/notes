#  Asynchronous Programming in Python

Asynchronous programming is a way to write **non-blocking code**—code that can perform other operations **while waiting** for slow tasks like network requests, file I/O, or database operations.

---

##  Synchronous vs Asynchronous

###  Synchronous Example

```python
def main():
    data = fetch_data()   # blocks until it finishes
    print(data)

 ```
If fetch_data() takes 5 seconds, your program is stuck doing nothing for 5 seconds.
```
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    return "Data received"

async def main():
    data = await fetch_data()
    print(data)

asyncio.run(main())
```
 While await asyncio.sleep(5) waits, the event loop can run other tasks.

 #  Key Concepts
async def: Declares a coroutine—a special function that can pause and resume.

await: Pauses execution at that line until the awaited coroutine finishes.

asyncio.run(): Starts the event loop and runs the top-level coroutine.

# Use Cases
Use asynchronous programming for:

API calls / HTTP requests

File I/O and database queries

Delayed execution (e.g., sleep)

Web scraping

Building high-performance APIs (e.g., FastAPI)

# Analogy
Imagine you're cooking:

 Synchronous: You wait at the stove while the water boils.

 Asynchronous: You start boiling water, then go chop vegetables while you wait.

# Benefits
Handles I/O-bound tasks more efficiently

Improves performance for apps dealing with many concurrent operations

Uses fewer system resources (threads/processes)

# Limitations
Not ideal for CPU-bound tasks like image processing or heavy computation.

For CPU-bound work, use multithreading or multiprocessing instead.

# What is a Coroutine?
A coroutine is a special kind of function in Python defined with async def that can pause its execution and resume later.

Think of it as a task that can yield control to other tasks, making concurrency possible without using threads.

 Example:
```
async def my_coroutine():
    print("Step 1")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # pauses here
    print("Step 2")
```
# What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is the core engine behind asynchronous programming. It:

Schedules coroutines.

Pauses them at await.

Resumes them once the awaited task completes.

# How it works:
Think of it as a manager that juggles multiple coroutines.

When one coroutine hits await, the loop switches to run another coroutine in the meantime.

# What Happens When a Coroutine Hits await?
Suppose your function looks like this:

```
async def example():
    print("Before await")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    print("After await")
```
# What happens:
print("Before await") runs immediately.

await asyncio.sleep(3) tells the event loop:

"I'm waiting for 3 seconds. You can do something else in the meantime."

During those 3 seconds, the event loop can run other tasks.

After 3 seconds, control comes back, and:

print("After await") is executed.

 So, code below await doesn't run immediately. It runs only after the awaited operation completes.

# Simple Analogy
You're calling a friend (I/O operation):

Before await: You pick up the phone and dial.

Await: You're waiting for them to answer. While waiting, you start folding laundry.

After await: They answer, and you start talking again (resume coroutine).

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coroutine          | A function that can pause (`await`) and resume.                       |
| Event Loop         | The scheduler that manages coroutines.                                |
| `await`            | Pause point; lets event loop run other coroutines until this resumes. |
| Code after `await` | Only runs **after** the awaited task completes.                       |

# How does FastAPI leverage asynchronous programming for performance?
Under the hood, FastAPI runs on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) servers like Uvicorn or Hypercorn, which use an event loop (via asyncio) to handle thousands of requests concurrently.

When one route is "awaiting" an I/O operation, the event loop switches to handle another request.

# What are the benefits of using asynchronous programming in FastAPI?

 Key Benefits of Asynchronous Programming in FastAPI
# 1.  High Performance and Concurrency
FastAPI can handle many requests concurrently using a single process.

When one request is waiting (e.g., on an API call or DB query), the server continues handling others.

This makes it highly scalable without needing multithreading or multiprocessing.

 Example: While await db.query() is waiting for a response, FastAPI can serve another user’s request.

# 2.  Non-blocking I/O Operations
With async and await, FastAPI doesn’t block the event loop.

You can interact with:

APIs via httpx

Databases via asyncpg, databases, Tortoise ORM

Files via aiofiles

```
@app.get("/external")
async def external_api():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    return response.json()
```
# 3.  Better Resource Utilization
Async functions use fewer threads and system resources than synchronous code.

Great for running on lightweight servers or containers (e.g., Docker).

# 4.  Built-in Async Ecosystem Support
FastAPI works seamlessly with async tools:

Tool	Purpose
httpx	Async HTTP client
databases	Async database access
Tortoise ORM, Gino, SQLModel	Async ORMs
aiofiles	Async file handling

# 5.  Scalability for Real-Time Systems
Async is ideal for systems with:

High concurrency (e.g., chat apps, real-time dashboards)

Long-lived connections (e.g., WebSockets)

API gateways and aggregators

# 6.  Improved Testability
Async functions can be tested using pytest with pytest-asyncio.

Makes it easier to write concurrent test cases for endpoints that rely on async I/O.

# When Not to Use Async?
For CPU-bound tasks (e.g., image processing, ML inference), async provides no benefit.

Instead, use:

Background tasks

concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor

multiprocessing
