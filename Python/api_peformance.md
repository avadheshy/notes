# Top 5 Common Ways to Improve API Performance

---

## 1. Result Pagination

**What it is**: Instead of returning all records at once, data is split into "pages" with a defined number of items per page.

**Why it matters**: Reduces server load and bandwidth usage while improving frontend performance.

```python
# Example with Flask and SQLAlchemy
@app.route('/items')
def get_items():
    page = request.args.get('page', 1, type=int)
    per_page = 10
    items = Item.query.paginate(page, per_page, False)
    return jsonify([item.serialize() for item in items.items])
```
2. Asynchronous Logging
What it is: Logs are written in a background thread rather than blocking the main execution.

Why it matters: Avoids performance bottlenecks from file I/O when logging frequently.

```
import logging
import queue
import threading

log_queue = queue.Queue()
def async_logger():
    while True:
        record = log_queue.get()
        if record is None: break
        logger.handle(record)

logger = logging.getLogger('async')
threading.Thread(target=async_logger, daemon=True).start()
```
3. Data Caching
What it is: Frequently requested data is temporarily stored in memory using systems like Redis or Memcached.

Why it matters: Significantly reduces database load and response time for repeated queries.

```
import redis
r = redis.Redis()

cached = r.get('my_key')
if cached:
    return cached
else:
    data = get_expensive_data()
    r.set('my_key', data, ex=3600)
    return data

```
4. Payload Compression
What it is: Data sent over the network is compressed using formats like gzip or Brotli.

Why it matters: Reduces network latency and improves performance over slow connections.

python
Copy
Edit
# Flask example
from flask_compress import Compress
app = Flask(__name__)
Compress(app)
ðŸ”¹ When to Use It
When API responses are large (e.g., 5KB+ JSON/XML data).

For mobile and global users with slow connections.

On stateless or read-heavy APIs that serve repetitive or cacheable data.

For public APIs with high traffic and broad device/browser support.

ðŸ”¹ When Not to Use It
When your API mostly returns very small responses (e.g., status codes, small JSON).

In real-time APIs where low latency is critical and CPU time matters more than bandwidth.

If clients can't support compression formats (e.g., legacy systems).

ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Conceptually)
Client sends request with Accept-Encoding header indicating it supports compressed formats like gzip or br.

Server checks this header and, if supported, compresses the response body accordingly.

Compressed response is sent over the network.

Client receives and decompresses the response before processing.

5. Connection Pooling
What it is: Reuses a pool of open database connections instead of opening a new one for every request.

Why it matters: Saves time and resources by avoiding frequent connect/disconnect overhead.

python
Copy
Edit
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://user:pass@host/db', pool_size=10, max_overflow=20)

with engine.connect() as conn:
    result = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
ðŸ”¹ Why Is It Needed?
Establishing a new connection to a database is expensive â€” it involves network round-trips, authentication, and resource allocation on both client and server. Doing this for every API call can drastically slow down performance, especially under high traffic.

Pooling avoids this by:

Keeping a limited number of open connections alive

Reusing them efficiently across multiple requests

ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Simplified)
Pool Initialization: A number of DB connections are created and stored in the pool (e.g., 10 connections).

Request Handling: When an API call needs the database, it borrows a connection from the pool.

Execution: The query is run using that connection.

Release: Once done, the connection is returned to the pool for future use.
