# Operating System Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is an Operating System? What are its main functions?

An Operating System (OS) is a system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and user applications. It manages computer resources and provides a platform for other software to run.

**Main functions of an Operating System:**

- **Process Management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
- **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory space to processes
- **File System Management**: Creating, deleting, and managing files and directories
- **Device Management**: Managing input/output devices and their drivers
- **Security and Access Control**: Protecting system resources from unauthorized access
- **User Interface**: Providing command-line or graphical interface for user interaction
- **Network Management**: Managing network connections and protocols

## 2. What is the difference between Process and Thread?

| Process | Thread |
|---------|--------|
| Independent execution unit with its own memory space | Lightweight execution unit within a process |
| Has separate address space | Shares address space with other threads in same process |
| Communication through Inter Process Communication (IPC) | Communication through shared memory |
| Creation is expensive | Creation is less expensive |
| Context switching is slower | Context switching is faster |
| If one process crashes, others are unaffected | If one thread crashes, entire process may crash |
| Example: Each application like browser, notepad | Example: Multiple tabs in a browser |

## 3. Explain Process States and Process State Diagram.

A process can be in one of several states during its lifetime:

**Process States:**
- **New**: Process is being created
- **Ready**: Process is ready to be assigned to CPU
- **Running**: Process is currently being executed by CPU
- **Waiting/Blocked**: Process is waiting for some event (I/O completion)
- **Terminated**: Process has finished execution

**State Transitions:**
- New → Ready: Process creation completed
- Ready → Running: CPU scheduler selects the process
- Running → Ready: Time quantum expires (preemption)
- Running → Waiting: Process requests I/O operation
- Waiting → Ready: I/O operation completed
- Running → Terminated: Process execution completed

## 4. What is CPU Scheduling? Explain different CPU scheduling algorithms.

CPU Scheduling is the process of determining which process should be allocated CPU time when multiple processes are ready to execute.

**CPU Scheduling Algorithms:**

### First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Processes are executed in the order they arrive
- Non-preemptive
- Can cause convoy effect (long processes delay shorter ones)

### Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Process with shortest burst time is executed first
- Can be preemptive (SRTF) or non-preemptive
- Optimal average waiting time but difficult to predict burst time

### Round Robin (RR)
- Each process gets a fixed time quantum
- Preemptive algorithm
- Fair allocation but high context switching overhead

### Priority Scheduling
- Processes are assigned priorities
- Higher priority processes execute first
- Can cause starvation of low-priority processes

### Multilevel Queue Scheduling
- Multiple queues with different priorities
- Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm
- Processes are permanently assigned to queues

## 5. What is Deadlock? What are the conditions for deadlock?

Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources.

**Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock (Coffman Conditions):**

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource must be held in non-shareable mode
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting for additional resources
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from processes
4. **Circular Wait**: There must be a circular chain of processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next process

**Deadlock Prevention Methods:**
- Eliminate any one of the four conditions
- Resource ordering to prevent circular wait
- Banker's algorithm for safe state checking

## 6. Explain Memory Management techniques.

Memory management involves organizing and controlling computer memory allocation.

**Memory Management Techniques:**

### Contiguous Memory Allocation
- **Fixed Partitioning**: Memory divided into fixed-size partitions
- **Variable Partitioning**: Memory divided into variable-size partitions
- Problems: Internal/External fragmentation

### Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation
- **Paging**: Logical memory divided into pages, physical memory into frames
- **Segmentation**: Memory divided into variable-size segments
- **Segmented Paging**: Combination of segmentation and paging

### Virtual Memory
- Allows execution of processes that may not be completely in memory
- Uses demand paging - pages loaded only when needed
- Provides illusion of large memory space

## 7. What is Virtual Memory? How does it work?

Virtual Memory is a memory management technique that provides an abstraction of storage resources, giving the illusion of a very large main memory.

**How Virtual Memory Works:**

1. **Address Translation**: Virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses
2. **Page Tables**: Maintain mapping between virtual and physical pages
3. **Demand Paging**: Pages are loaded into memory only when accessed
4. **Page Replacement**: When memory is full, some pages are swapped to disk

**Benefits:**
- Programs can be larger than physical memory
- Better memory utilization
- Easier programming (no need to manage overlays)
- Better multiprogramming

**Page Replacement Algorithms:**
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Optimal Page Replacement
- Clock Algorithm

## 8. What is Paging and Segmentation?

### Paging
- Logical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called **pages**
- Physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called **frames**
- Pages can be loaded into any available frame
- Uses page table for address translation
- Eliminates external fragmentation but may cause internal fragmentation

### Segmentation
- Memory is divided into variable-size segments based on logical units
- Each segment has a name/number and length
- Segments can grow dynamically
- Uses segment table for address translation
- Eliminates internal fragmentation but may cause external fragmentation

**Comparison:**
| Paging | Segmentation |
|--------|--------------|
| Fixed-size divisions | Variable-size divisions |
| Invisible to programmer | Visible to programmer |
| No external fragmentation | May have external fragmentation |
| May have internal fragmentation | No internal fragmentation |

## 9. Explain Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms.

IPC allows processes to communicate and synchronize with each other.

**IPC Mechanisms:**

### Shared Memory
- Processes share a common memory region
- Fast communication method
- Requires synchronization mechanisms
- Example: POSIX shared memory

### Message Passing
- Processes communicate by sending/receiving messages
- Can be synchronous or asynchronous
- Two models: Direct communication, Indirect communication (mailboxes)

### Pipes
- **Anonymous Pipes**: Communication between parent and child processes
- **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**: Communication between unrelated processes

### Signals
- Software interrupts sent to processes
- Used for notification of events
- Example: SIGKILL, SIGTERM

### Semaphores
- Used for process synchronization
- Binary semaphores (mutex) or counting semaphores

### Sockets
- Communication between processes on same or different machines
- Support network communication

## 10. What are Semaphores? Explain Producer-Consumer problem.

**Semaphores** are synchronization primitives used to control access to shared resources.

**Types of Semaphores:**
- **Binary Semaphore (Mutex)**: Can have values 0 or 1
- **Counting Semaphore**: Can have non-negative integer values

**Semaphore Operations:**
- **Wait (P operation)**: Decrements semaphore value, blocks if value becomes negative
- **Signal (V operation)**: Increments semaphore value, wakes up blocked processes

### Producer-Consumer Problem

**Problem**: Producers generate data and put into buffer, consumers take data from buffer. Need to synchronize access to shared buffer.

**Solution using Semaphores:**

```c
// Shared variables
int buffer[N];
int in = 0, out = 0;
semaphore mutex = 1;      // Binary semaphore for buffer access
semaphore empty = N;      // Count of empty slots
semaphore full = 0;       // Count of full slots

// Producer Process
void producer() {
    while(true) {
        // Produce item
        wait(empty);          // Wait for empty slot
        wait(mutex);          // Lock buffer
        buffer[in] = item;    // Add item to buffer
        in = (in + 1) % N;
        signal(mutex);        // Unlock buffer
        signal(full);         // Signal full slot
    }
}

// Consumer Process
void consumer() {
    while(true) {
        wait(full);           // Wait for full slot
        wait(mutex);          // Lock buffer
        item = buffer[out];   // Remove item from buffer
        out = (out + 1) % N;
        signal(mutex);        // Unlock buffer
        signal(empty);        // Signal empty slot
        // Consume item
    }
}
```

## 11. What is File System? Explain different file allocation methods.

A File System is a method for storing and organizing files on storage devices.

**File Allocation Methods:**

### Contiguous Allocation
- Files are stored in contiguous blocks on disk
- **Advantages**: Simple, fast sequential access
- **Disadvantages**: External fragmentation, file size changes difficult

### Linked Allocation
- Each file is a linked list of disk blocks
- **Advantages**: No external fragmentation, dynamic file size
- **Disadvantages**: No random access, pointer overhead

### Indexed Allocation
- Each file has an index block containing pointers to data blocks
- **Advantages**: Random access, no external fragmentation
- **Disadvantages**: Index block overhead

**File System Components:**
- **Boot Block**: Contains bootstrap code
- **Super Block**: Contains file system metadata
- **Inode Table**: Contains file metadata (Unix-like systems)
- **Data Blocks**: Actual file content

## 12. Explain different types of Operating Systems.

### Batch Operating System
- Jobs are processed in batches without user interaction
- High throughput but no interactivity
- Example: Early mainframe systems

### Time-Sharing Operating System
- Multiple users share CPU time through time slicing
- Provides interactive computing
- Example: Unix, Linux with multiple terminals

### Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
- **Hard Real-Time**: Strict timing constraints must be met
- **Soft Real-Time**: Timing constraints are important but not critical
- Example: Embedded systems, industrial control

### Distributed Operating System
- Resources are distributed across multiple machines
- Appears as single system to users
- Example: Amoeba, Plan 9

### Network Operating System
- Provides services to computers connected over network
- Each machine maintains its own OS
- Example: Windows Server, Novell NetWare

### Mobile Operating System
- Designed for mobile devices
- Focus on power efficiency and touch interfaces
- Example: Android, iOS

## 13. What is System Call? Give examples.

System Calls are programming interfaces that allow user programs to request services from the operating system kernel.

**Types of System Calls:**

### Process Control
- `fork()`: Create new process
- `exec()`: Execute program

- `msgget()`: Get message queue

**System Call Implementation:**
1. User program makes system call
2. Mode switch from user to kernel mode
3. Kernel executes requested service
4. Return to user mode with results

## 14. What is the difference between Multiprogramming and Multiprocessing?

| Multiprogramming | Multiprocessing |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Multiple programs in memory, CPU switches between them | Multiple CPUs/cores execute programs simultaneously |
| Single CPU system | Multiple CPU system |
| Increases CPU utilization | Increases overall system throughput |
| Context switching between processes | Parallel execution of processes |
| Example: Running multiple applications on single-core system | Example: Running applications on multi-core system |

**Multiprogramming Benefits:**
- Better CPU utilization
- Reduced idle time
- Better system throughput

**Multiprocessing Benefits:**
- True parallel execution
- Better performance for CPU-intensive tasks
- Fault tolerance (if one CPU fails, others continue)

## 15. Explain Critical Section Problem and its solutions.

**Critical Section** is a segment of code where shared resources are accessed and must be executed atomically.

**Critical Section Problem Requirements:**
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can be in critical section at a time
2. **Progress**: If no process is in critical section, selection of next process should not be postponed indefinitely
3. **Bounded Waiting**: There should be a limit on number of times other processes can enter critical section after a process has made request

**Solutions:**

### Peterson's Solution (Software Solution)
```c
// For two processes P0 and P1
int turn = 0;
boolean flag[2] = {false, false};

// Process Pi (i = 0 or 1)
void process(int i) {
    int j = 1 - i;  // Other process
    
    // Entry section
    flag[i] = true;
    turn = j;
    while(flag[j] && turn == j);
    
    // Critical section
    
    // Exit section
    flag[i] = false;
    
    // Remainder section
}
```

### Hardware Solutions
- **Test and Set**: Atomic instruction to test and modify memory
- **Compare and Swap**: Atomic instruction to compare and exchange values
- **Disable Interrupts**: Prevent context switching during critical section

### Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
- Binary semaphore used for mutual exclusion
- Only one process can acquire mutex at a time

## 16. What is Thrashing in Operating Systems?

**Thrashing** is a condition where the system spends more time in page swapping than in executing processes.

**Causes of Thrashing:**
- High degree of multiprogramming
- Insufficient physical memory
- Poor page replacement algorithm
- Processes have poor locality of reference

**Effects of Thrashing:**
- Severe performance degradation
- High disk I/O activity
- Low CPU utilization
- System becomes unresponsive

**Solutions to Prevent Thrashing:**
- **Working Set Model**: Keep frequently used pages in memory
- **Page Fault Frequency**: Monitor page fault rate
- **Reduce Degree of Multiprogramming**: Suspend some processes
- **Increase Physical Memory**: Add more RAM
- **Better Page Replacement Algorithm**: Use LRU or optimal algorithm

**Working Set**: Set of pages that a process is actively using. If working set is in memory, thrashing is less likely.

## 17. Explain Memory Protection mechanisms.

Memory Protection prevents processes from accessing memory locations not allocated to them.

**Memory Protection Mechanisms:**

### Base and Limit Registers
- Base register: Starting address of process memory
- Limit register: Size of process memory
- Hardware checks all memory accesses

### Segmentation with Protection
- Each segment has protection bits (read, write, execute)
- Segment table contains protection information
- Hardware checks permissions on each access

### Paging with Protection
- Page table entries contain protection bits
- Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) caches protection info
- Memory Management Unit (MMU) enforces protection

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
- Randomizes memory layout of processes
- Makes buffer overflow attacks difficult
- Implemented in modern operating systems

**Protection Mechanisms:**
- **User/Kernel Mode**: Separate privilege levels
- **Memory Segmentation**: Logical separation of memory regions
- **Access Control Lists**: Fine-grained permission control
- **Stack Canaries**: Detect buffer overflow attacks
