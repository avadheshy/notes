# What is an EC2 Instance?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual server in the AWS cloud that lets you run applications just like a physical machine — but scalable, on-demand, and with flexible pricing.
- In short: An EC2 instance is a virtual machine on AWS.
  
# Common Use Cases of EC2:
```

```
# EC2 Pricing Models:
- On-Demand – Pay by the hour/second, no commitment.

- Reserved – 1 or 3-year commitment, lower cost.

- Spot – Buy unused EC2 capacity at discount (can be interrupted).

- Savings Plans – Flexible pricing based on usage commitment.


# EC2 Instance Basics:
Understanding the concept of virtual servers and instances. Key components of an EC2 instance: AMI (Amazon Machine Image), instance types, and instance states. Differentiating between On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances.

# Requirements gathering for EC2
- OS which os to select
- Size Ram/CPU/Network
- Project Taging purpose
- Services/App Running(http,ssh,mysql)
- Environment Dev?prod/staging?Qa
- Loging User Owner

# Launching an EC2 Instance:
- Step-by-step guide on launching an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.
- Configuring instance details, such as instance type, network settings, and storage options.
- Understanding security groups and key pairs for securing instances.
  ```
  Names and tags->AMI->Instance Type->EBS(Elastic Block storage)->Tag (for filtering)-> Target Group->Keys
  ```
  - Create a Key pair for logging purpose(make it for every envirnment)
  - Make a security Group (That will be attach to ec2 Network Interface)
  - And name and tags to ec2 instance.
  - select AMI & elect Instance type
  - select key pair and security Group
  - cofigure storge and launch instance
  # elastic ip
  it is a public ip
# What is Inbound and Outbound Rules ?
In network security (especially in cloud services like AWS EC2), Inbound and Outbound Rules control the flow of traffic to and from a resource, like a virtual server or security group.
- It is related to security group.
# Security Gooup
- Acts as a firewall for one or more instances
- You can add inbound and outbound rule to security groups that will be apply on ec2.
- They are statefull.
# Inbound Rules
- Control incoming traffic to your instance or server.

- Think of it as “Who is allowed to talk to me?”

Examples:

- Allow HTTP (port 80) from the internet.

- Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP only.
```
From: 0.0.0.0/0     Protocol: TCP     Port: 80     Action: Allow
```
# Outbound Rules
Control outgoing traffic from your instance to the outside world.

Think of it as “Who can I talk to?”

Examples:

- Allow all outbound internet traffic.

- Restrict to internal IP ranges only.


# Managing EC2 Instances:
- Starting, stopping, and terminating instances.
- Monitoring instance performance and utilization.
- Basic troubleshooting and accessing instances using SSH (Secure Shell).
In AWS, regions, availability zones, and data centers are distinct concepts that together form the backbone of AWS's infrastructure:

# 1. Region
## Definition: 
A region is a geographically distinct location where AWS clusters its data centers. Each region is completely independent of the others.
Purpose: Provides the ability to place resources close to end-users for lower latency and compliance with data sovereignty regulations.
## Characteristics:
Contains multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
Examples: us-east-1 (North Virginia), eu-west-1 (Ireland).
Communication between regions usually has higher latency and may incur data transfer costs.
# 2. Availability Zone (AZ)
## Definition: An availability zone is a distinct, isolated location within a region. Each AZ consists of one or more physical data centers.
Purpose: Provides redundancy and fault tolerance within a region.
## Characteristics:
Designed to be isolated from failures in other AZs in the same region.
Connected to other AZs in the region via low-latency, high-speed networking.
AWS resources like EC2 instances can be deployed across AZs for high availability.
# 3. Data Center
## Definition: A data center is a physical facility housing the servers, storage, and networking hardware that powers AWS services. It is the smallest unit of AWS's infrastructure.
Purpose: Forms the building blocks of AZs.
## Characteristics:
Each AZ contains multiple data centers, but the exact number is not disclosed by AWS.
Built with redundancy for power, networking, and cooling to maintain high availability.
