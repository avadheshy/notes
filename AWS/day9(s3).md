## Key Concepts

### Buckets
- **Definition**: A container for objects stored in S3
- **Global namespace**: Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts
- **Regional**: Buckets are created in specific AWS regions
- **Flat structure**: No hierarchical structure, but prefixes create folder-like organization

### Objects
- **Definition**: Files stored in S3 buckets
- **Components**: Object data, metadata, and unique key (name)
- **Size limits**: 0 bytes to 5 TB per object
- **Versioning**: Multiple versions of the same object can coexist

### Keys
- **Definition**: Unique identifier for objects within a bucket
- **Format**: String of Unicode characters up to 1,024 bytes
- **Prefixes**: Use forward slashes to create folder-like structure

## Bucket Creation and Configuration

### Naming Requirements
- 3-63 characters long
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods only
- Must start and end with letter or number
- Cannot be formatted as IP address
- Cannot start with "xn--" or end with "-s3alias"

### Creation Process
```bash
# AWS CLI example
aws s3 mb s3://my-unique-bucket-name --region us-east-1
```

### Configuration Options
- **Region selection**: Choose based on latency, compliance, and cost
- **Versioning**: Enable to keep multiple versions of objects

      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- **Legacy method**: Predates IAM
- **Limited granularity**: Basic read/write permissions
- **Recommendation**: Use bucket policies instead

### IAM Policies
- **User-based**: Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles
- **Fine-grained**: Specific actions and resources
- **Cross-service**: Can combine with other AWS services

### Block Public Access
- **Four settings**:
  1. Block public access via new ACLs
  2. Block public access via any ACLs
  3. Block public access via new bucket policies
  4. Block public access via any bucket policies

### Encryption

#### Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
- **SSE-S3**: Amazon-managed keys
- **SSE-KMS**: AWS KMS managed keys
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys

#### Client-Side Encryption
- **Customer responsibility**: Encrypt data before upload
- **AWS SDK support**: Built-in encryption libraries

## Data Management Features

### Versioning
- **Purpose**: Protect against accidental deletion/modification

    {
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {"Prefix": "logs/"},
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        }
      ],
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 2555
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
