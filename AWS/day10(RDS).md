#  RDS (Relational Database Service) Administration

**Amazon RDS** is a fully managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It handles many of the complex and time-consuming administrative tasks associated with databases.

---

##  Traditional DB Administration Tasks

Before RDS, a database administrator (DBA) was responsible for:

-  Installation & Configuration
-  Patching and Updates
-  Monitoring & Alerts
-  Performance Tuning
-  Backup & Restore
-  Scaling (Vertical & Horizontal)
-  Hardware Provisioning
-  Storage & Capacity Management

##  VPC Integration

- RDS can be launched inside a **private VPC subnet**
- You can make the RDS **publicly accessible** or **VPC-internal only**
- Control access using **Security Groups** and **Subnet Groups**

8. **Authentication Options**
   - Password authentication
   - IAM database authentication (optional)

9. **Initial DB Name**
   - Provide a default DB name (optional)

10. **Encryption**
    - Enable encryption with AWS KMS (optional)

11. **Log Export**
    - Export logs to **CloudWatch Logs** (for audit/troubleshooting)

12. **Backup Configuration**
    - Enable automated backups
    - Set retention period
    - Configure backup window

13. **Maintenance**
    - Set preferred maintenance window
    - Enable/disable auto minor version upgrades
