# VPC Design & Components

This section explores VPC designs and the different components that make up a VPC architecture.

## Basic VPC Design Overview

A **VPC** is the main network that gets divided into smaller **subnets**. Understanding the different types of subnets and their connectivity is fundamental to VPC design.

### Types of Subnets

#### 🌐 Public Subnet
- **Definition:** A subnet that can be reached directly from the internet
- **Characteristics:**
  - EC2 instances have public IP addresses
  - Can access the internet bidirectionally
  - Internet traffic can reach instances directly
  - Used for web servers, load balancers, bastion hosts

**Example:** When you SSH into an EC2 instance using its public IP, that instance resides in a public subnet.

#### 🔒 Private Subnet
- **Definition:** A subnet where internet traffic cannot directly reach the instances
- **Characteristics:**
  - Instances only have private IP addresses
  - No direct internet access for inbound traffic
  - Enhanced security for backend systems
  - Used for databases, application servers, internal services

## Core VPC Components

### Internet Gateway (IGW)

**Purpose:** Connects public subnets to the internet

**Key Features:**
- **Virtual device** managed by AWS
- **Highly available** and redundant
- **Bidirectional connectivity** (inbound and outbound)
- **Free of charge**
- **One per VPC**

**Function:** Makes a subnet "public" by providing direct internet access.

### NAT Gateway

**Purpose:** Enables private subnet instances to access the internet securely

**Key Features:**
- **Outbound-only** internet connectivity
- **Network Address Translation** functionality
- **Resides in public subnet**
- **Managed by AWS** (high availability)
- **Chargeable resource**

**Analogy:** Think of the NAT Gateway as your WiFi router:
- Your laptop (private instance) can connect to the internet
- The internet cannot directly connect to your laptop
- The router (NAT Gateway) has a public IP
- Your laptop has a private IP

### Route Tables

**Purpose:** Direct network traffic to appropriate gateways

**Function:**
- **Attached to subnets**
- **Determine traffic routing decisions**
- **Control access patterns**

**Routing Logic:**
- **Public subnet route table** → Points to Internet Gateway
- **Private subnet route table** → Points to NAT Gateway

## High Availability Design

### Availability Zone Distribution

AWS regions contain multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**:
- **Minimum:** 2 AZs per region
- **Maximum:** Up to 6 AZs in some regions
- **AZs:** Independent clusters of data centers

### Multi-AZ Subnet Architecture

```
Region (e.g., us-east-1)
├── Availability Zone A
│   ├── Public Subnet A
│   └── Private Subnet A
└── Availability Zone B
    ├── Public Subnet B
    └── Private Subnet B
```

### Benefits of Multi-AZ Design:
- **Fault tolerance:** If one AZ fails, others remain operational
- **Load distribution:** Spread workload across zones
- **Reduced latency:** Serve users from nearest zone
- **Disaster recovery:** Built-in redundancy

**Example Scenario:**
- 4 web servers distributed across 2 public subnets
- If one AZ fails, only 50% of infrastructure is affected
- Remaining servers continue serving traffic

## Advanced Components

### Bastion Host (Jump Server)

**Purpose:** Secure access to private subnet instances

**How it works:**
1. **Deploy** EC2 instance in public subnet
2. **Connect** to bastion host from internet
3. **Jump** from bastion host to private instances
4. **Secure** indirect access to private resources

**Security Benefits:**
- **Single point of entry** to private subnets
- **Centralized access control**
- **Audit trail** for private resource access
- **Reduced attack surface**

### VPN Connection

**Purpose:** Connect private subnets to corporate networks

**Use Cases:**
- **Hybrid cloud** connectivity
- **Direct access** to private instances using private IPs
- **Corporate network** integration
- **Secure communication** channels

## Network Communication Rules

### Inter-Subnet Communication
By default, **all subnets within a VPC can communicate** with each other:
- ✅ Public subnet ↔ Private subnet
- ✅ Private subnet ↔ Private subnet  
- ✅ Public subnet ↔ Public subnet

### Internet Access Patterns

| Subnet Type | Inbound Internet | Outbound Internet | Gateway Used |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Public**  | ✅ Direct       | ✅ Direct         | Internet Gateway |
| **Private** | ❌ Blocked      | ✅ Via NAT        | NAT Gateway |

## Cost Considerations

### Free Components:
- ✅ **VPC creation**
- ✅ **Subnets**
- ✅ **Route tables**
- ✅ **Internet Gateway**

### Chargeable Components:
- 💰 **NAT Gateway** (hourly + data processing charges)
- 💰 **EC2 instances** (bastion hosts, application servers)
- 💰 **VPN connections** (if used)

## High Availability NAT Gateway Design

For **production environments**, deploy NAT Gateways across multiple AZs:

```
Region
├── AZ-A
│   ├── Public Subnet A → NAT Gateway A
│   └── Private Subnet A → Routes to NAT Gateway A
└── AZ-B
    ├── Public Subnet B → NAT Gateway B
    └── Private Subnet B → Routes to NAT Gateway B
```

**Benefits:**
- **Eliminates single point of failure**
- **Improves performance** (reduced cross-AZ traffic)
- **Ensures connectivity** if one NAT Gateway fails

## Complete VPC Architecture Example

```
VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
├── Internet Gateway
├── AZ-A (us-east-1a)
│   ├── Public Subnet A (10.0.1.0/24)
│   │   ├── NAT Gateway A
│   │   ├── Bastion Host
│   │   └── Web Server 1
│   └── Private Subnet A (10.0.3.0/24)
│       ├── App Server 1
│       └── Database Server 1
└── AZ-B (us-east-1b)
    ├── Public Subnet B (10.0.2.0/24)
    │   ├── NAT Gateway B
    │   └── Web Server 2
    └── Private Subnet B (10.0.4.0/24)
        ├── App Server 2
        └── Database Server 2
```

## Design Best Practices

### Security
- 🔒 **Place sensitive resources** in private subnets
- 🔒 **Use bastion hosts** for secure access
- 🔒 **Implement least privilege** access
- 🔒 **Enable VPC Flow Logs** for monitoring

### High Availability
- 🏗️ **Distribute across multiple AZs**
- 🏗️ **Deploy redundant NAT Gateways**
- 🏗️ **Use Auto Scaling Groups**
- 🏗️ **Implement health checks**

### Cost Optimization
- 💡 **Share NAT Gateways** when possible
- 💡 **Use NAT Instances** for development (cheaper)
- 💡 **Monitor data transfer costs**
- 💡 **Right-size NAT Gateway capacity**
