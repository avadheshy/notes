# What is IAM (Identity and Acccess Management) ?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that ensures the right individuals have the right access to the right resources at the right time.

- In short: IAM controls who can access what, and what they can do with it.
  
#  Core Components of IAM:
```
| Component            | Description                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity**         | The **user or system** (e.g., an employee, admin, application, or device). |
| **Authentication**   | Verifying **who you are** (e.g., password, OTP, biometrics).               |
| **Authorization**    | Determining **what youâ€™re allowed to do** (e.g., read-only, admin).        |
| **Roles/Policies**   | Define sets of **permissions** for different users or groups.              |
| **Audit/Monitoring** | Track who accessed what and when for **security and compliance**.          |

```
# Why IAM is Important ?:
- Security: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

- User Management: Easily onboard/offboard users and assign roles.

- Compliance: Required for regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

- Efficiency: Automates access based on job roles.

# Common IAM Features:
- Single Sign-On (SSO): One login for multiple applications.

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Extra security layer beyond passwords.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access based on job responsibilities.

- Least Privilege: Users get only the access they need, nothing more.
